      <h2>Other Pronouns</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the personal pronouns and the article, Koine Greek employs a
        variety of pronouns that serve crucial roles in conveying emphasis,
        reference, indefiniteness, reflexivity, reciprocity, and interrogation.
        These include demonstrative, reflexive, reciprocal, indefinite, and
        interrogative pronouns. Each group follows distinct morphological
        patterns across gender, number, and case, and their syntactic usage
        interacts significantly with the article and broader discourse context.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Paradigms</h3>

      <h4>
        Demonstrative Pronouns – <em>οὗτος</em> (“this”),
        <em>ἐκεῖνος</em> (“that”)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Demonstratives function adjectivally and substantivally, pointing out
        specific entities in space, time, or discourse. They decline similarly
        to first and second declension adjectives, but with irregular stems.
      </p>

            <th>Case</th>
            <th>Masculine (οὗτος)</th>

            <th>Neuter (τοῦτο)</th>
          </tr>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        The demonstrative <em>ἐκεῖνος</em> (“that”) follows the same endings as
        a regular 2-1-2 adjective, declining straightforwardly with the stem
        <em>ἐκειν-</em>.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Reflexive Pronouns – <em>ἐμαυτοῦ</em>, <em>σεαυτοῦ</em>, <em>ἑαυτοῦ</em>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject and do not appear in the
        nominative case. They are compounded from a personal pronoun and the
        genitive form of the adjective <em>αὐτός</em>. These pronouns are used
        for the first, second, and third persons respectively.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Case</th>
            <th>1st Person (ἐμαυτοῦ)</th>
            <th>2nd Person (σεαυτοῦ)</th>
            <th>3rd Person (ἑαυτοῦ)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Genitive Sg.</th>
            <td>ἐμαυτοῦ</td>
            <td>σεαυτοῦ</td>
            <td>ἑαυτοῦ</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Dative Sg.</th>
            <td>ἐμαυτῷ</td>
            <td>σεαυτῷ</td>
            <td>ἑαυτῷ</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Accusative Sg.</th>
            <td>ἐμαυτόν</td>
            <td>σεαυτόν</td>
            <td>ἑαυτόν</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        The reflexive for the third person, <em>ἑαυτοῦ</em>, is frequently used
        for all genders and numbers when the reflexive sense is required for the
        subject of the clause.
      </p>

      <h4>Reciprocal Pronoun – <em>ἀλλήλων</em> (“one another”)</h4>
      <p>
        This pronoun appears only in the plural and typically in the genitive
        case, reflecting mutual or reciprocal action. It behaves like a second
        declension adjective in form, although only a subset of case forms is
        commonly attested.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Case</th>
            <th>Masculine/Feminine</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Genitive Pl.</th>
            <td>ἀλλήλων</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Dative Pl.</th>
            <td>ἀλλήλοις / ἀλλήλαις</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Accusative Pl.</th>
            <td>ἀλλήλους / ἀλλήλας</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4>Indefinite Pronoun – <em>τις, τι</em> (“someone, something”)</h4>
      <p>
        The indefinite pronoun denotes an unspecified person or thing. It uses
        enclitic accentuation and resembles the interrogative in form but is
        distinguished by stress: <em>τις</em> (indefinite) vs.
        <em>τίς</em> (interrogative). It follows a third declension pattern.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Case</th>
            <th>Masculine/Feminine</th>
            <th>Neuter</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Nominative Sg.</th>
            <td>τις</td>
            <td>τι</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Genitive Sg.</th>
            <td>τινός</td>
            <td>τινός</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Dative Sg.</th>
            <td>τινί</td>
            <td>τινί</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Accusative Sg.</th>
            <td>τινά</td>
            <td>τι</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4>Interrogative Pronoun – <em>τίς, τί</em> (“who?, what?”)</h4>
      <p>
        The interrogative pronoun poses direct or indirect questions. It is
        identical in form to the indefinite except for its accent (acute on the
        first syllable). Its declension mirrors that of <em>τις</em>.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Case</th>
            <th>Masculine/Feminine</th>
            <th>Neuter</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Nominative Sg.</th>
            <td>τίς</td>
            <td>τί</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Genitive Sg.</th>
            <td>τίνος</td>
            <td>τίνος</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Dative Sg.</th>
            <td>τίνι</td>
            <td>τίνι</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Accusative Sg.</th>
            <td>τίνα</td>
            <td>τί</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Usage and Syntax</h3>
      <p>
        These pronouns vary morphologically across gender and number, though
        some (such as <em>τις</em> and <em>τίς</em>) maintain neuter
        distinctions only in the nominative and accusative singular.
        Demonstratives frequently combine with the article to mark emphasis or
        near vs. far deixis. Reflexives require a subject antecedent and must
        align in person and number. The reciprocal <em>ἀλλήλων</em> implies
        mutuality and never appears in the singular. Indefinite and
        interrogative forms differ only in accentuation but require careful
        contextual reading to distinguish between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In discourse, demonstratives frequently establish or maintain
        referential cohesion, while reflexives and reciprocals express
        intra-clausal relationships. The interaction between pronouns and the
        article is especially prominent with demonstratives and interrogatives,
        where their use can imply definiteness or emphasis, depending on word
        order and clause structure.
