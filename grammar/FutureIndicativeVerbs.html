      <h2>Future Indicative Verbs</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>future indicative</strong> in New Testament Greek expresses
        actions that are expected to occur in the future. While its primary
        function is to denote future time, the aspectual force is generally
        undefined or neutral. The future forms are closely related to the
        present indicative, but they are marked by characteristic morphological
        features, especially the use of the future tense stem, typically formed
        with the insertion of the <strong>σ</strong> marker.

      <h3>Conceptual Categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>σ Marker:</strong> The hallmark of the future tense is the
          insertion of the <strong>σ</strong> (sigma) between the present stem
          and the personal endings. This σ serves as the morphological indicator
          of futurity. For example, in <em>λύω</em> (“I loose”) the future
          becomes <em>λύσω</em> (“I will loose”), where <strong>λυ-</strong> +
          <strong>σ</strong> + <strong>ω</strong> = <em>λύσω</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Voice and Meaning Differences:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <em>active future</em> describes what the subject will do:
              <em>λύσω</em> – "I will loose."
            </li>
            <li>
              The <em>middle future</em> often implies the subject is acting
              with reference to self or for personal interest:
              <em>λύσομαι</em> – "I will loose for myself."
            </li>
            <li>
              Note: The <em>future passive</em> has distinct forms (e.g.,
              <em>λυθήσομαι</em>) and is treated separately.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time vs. Aspect:</strong> The future indicative primarily
          communicates <em>future time</em>, unlike other Greek tenses which
          emphasize aspect. The future does not inherently express either
          perfective or imperfective aspect; it is generally regarded as
          aspectually neutral or undefined. This allows the tense to focus
          strictly on indicating that the action will occur.
