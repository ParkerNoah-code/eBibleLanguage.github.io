      <h2>Imperatives</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>imperative mood</strong> in New Testament Greek is the
        primary verbal form used to express commands, exhortations, and
        prohibitions. Unlike the indicative, which makes assertions about
        reality, the imperative directly enjoins the listener or reader to
        act—or in some cases, to refrain from acting. The imperative exists in
        the second and third persons only, reflecting the fact that one cannot
        directly command oneself or make a demand of the first person.

      <h3>Conceptual Categories</h3>
      <p>
        The imperative mood expresses the speaker’s will or desire for an action
        to be performed. In the second person, this may appear as a direct
        command (“<em>λῦσον</em>” – loose!), while in the third person it
        functions more as a permission or strong exhortation directed toward a
        third party (“<em>λυσάτω</em>” – let him loose!).
      </p>

      <p>
        Greek imperatives are not only marked for person and number but also for
        aspect. The <strong>present imperative</strong> emphasizes an action
        that is ongoing, habitual, or general in nature (“<em>λῦε</em>” – keep
        loosing, continue loosing). In contrast, the
        <strong>aorist imperative</strong> presents the action as a whole,
        undefined event—often perceived as a specific or one-time command
        (“<em>λῦσον</em>” – loose!). The relatively rare
        <strong>perfect imperative</strong> signifies a command to maintain a
        completed state (“<em>λέλυκε</em>” – continue in the state of having
        been loosed).
      </p>

      <p>
        While most attention is given to second-person imperatives in
        instruction and narrative, third-person imperatives are common in
        liturgical, legal, or epistolary contexts. They are typically rendered
        in English with “let him/her/them...” or “may...” constructions.
        Third-person commands reflect the speaker's desire for action that is
        not directly executed by the hearer but still within the scope of
        exhortation or regulation.
