      <h2>Infinitives</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>infinitive</strong> in New Testament Greek is a verbal noun.
        It expresses verbal action in an abstract or non-finite manner—without
        regard to person or number—and often functions grammatically like a
        noun. Greek infinitives preserve distinctions of <em>aspect</em> and
        <em>voice</em>, and they are frequently employed in indirect discourse,
        with impersonal verbs, and after certain prepositions.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Paradigms</h3>

      <h4>Present Active Infinitive – λύειν ("to be loosing")</h4>
      <p>
        Formed by adding -ειν to the present stem (λυ-), this infinitive
        expresses an <em>imperfective aspect</em>—ongoing, repeated, or habitual
        action without reference to its beginning or end. It is used when the
        focus is on the <em>process</em> rather than the result.
      </p>

      <h4>Aorist Active Infinitive – λῦσαι ("to loose")</h4>
      <p>
        Built from the aorist stem, typically marked by an augment-stripped form
        and the suffix -σαι. The aorist infinitive reflects a
        <em>perfective aspect</em>, portraying the action as a whole or as a
        complete event. It does not denote past time but rather undivided
        action.
      </p>

      <h4>Perfect Active Infinitive – λελυκέναι ("to have loosed")</h4>
      <p>
        Derived from the perfect stem (with the reduplication and κ-perfect
        marker), this form emphasizes the <em>resulting state</em> of a
        completed action. It conveys a <em>stative aspect</em>, describing an
        action whose effects or consequences persist.
      </p>

      <h4>Aorist Passive Infinitive – λυθῆναι ("to be loosed")</h4>
      <p>
        Formed using the first aorist passive stem and the ending -ῆναι. This
        infinitive expresses perfective aspect in the passive voice, viewing the
        action as a whole and completed from the standpoint of the subject
        receiving the action.
      </p>

      <h3>Conceptual Categories</h3>

      <h4>Aspectual Distinctions</h4>
      <p>
        Unlike English infinitives, Greek infinitives encode verbal
        <em>aspect</em> clearly. The present infinitive (λύειν) focuses on the
        process or duration of the action. The aorist infinitive (λῦσαι) views
        the action as a unit or whole. The perfect infinitive (λελυκέναι)
        emphasizes the state resulting from a completed action. This aspectual
        precision plays a significant exegetical role, particularly in
        theological contexts where the nuance between process and completion
        affects interpretation.
      </p>

      <h4>Use in Indirect Discourse</h4>
      <p>
        Infinitives often appear in indirect statements after verbs of saying,
        thinking, knowing, or perceiving (e.g., λέγω, οἶδα, δοκέω). The subject
        of the infinitive is typically in the accusative case—a construction
        known as the <em>accusative and infinitive</em>. For example: λέγει τὸν
        ἄνθρωπον λῦσαι τὸν δοῦλον ("He says that the man loosed the slave").
      </p>

      <h4>Use with Prepositions and Impersonal Verbs</h4>
      <p>
        Several prepositions govern infinitives, often forming idiomatic
        expressions. For example, πρὸ τοῦ λῦσαι means "before loosing," while ἐν
        τῷ λύειν conveys "while loosing" or "during the act of loosing." Such
        constructions contribute to temporal or causal nuance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infinitives are also used with impersonal verbs and expressions, such as
        δεῖ ("it is necessary") or ἔξεστιν ("it is lawful"). In such cases, the
        infinitive functions as the true subject of the sentence: δεῖ λῦσαι τὸν
        δοῦλον ("It is necessary to loose the slave").
