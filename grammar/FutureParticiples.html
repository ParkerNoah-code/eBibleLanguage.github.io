      <h2>Future Participles</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>future participle</strong> in New Testament Greek is a
        non-finite verbal form that expresses action that is yet to occur,
        typically with a strong element of purpose or intention. Though it
        appears relatively infrequently in the New Testament and more often in
        literary or elevated Greek, its usage remains theologically and
        syntactically significant. The future participle shares many
        morphological characteristics with other participial forms but is
        uniquely marked by its future tense stem and active or middle voice
        endings.

      <h3>Conceptual Function</h3>
      <p>
        The future participle primarily communicates action that is expected or
        intended to happen after the main verb’s action. While morphologically
        built from the <strong>future tense stem</strong> (e.g.,
        <em>λυσ-</em> from <em>λύω</em>), it retains the adjectival and verbal
        force of other participles. It agrees in case, number, and gender with
        the noun it modifies and is declined like a first/second declension
        adjective.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its most prominent usage is to express <strong>purpose</strong>,
        particularly in construction with verbs of intention or imminence. One
        of the clearest examples is its combination with <em>μέλλω</em> ("I am
        about to"), where the participle elaborates the specific action
        anticipated. For example, <em>μέλλει λυσῶν τὴν πόλιν</em> may be
        understood as "He is about to loose the city."
      </p>

      <p>
        In another function, the future participle can have a more
        <strong>predictive force</strong>, indicating what someone is expected
        to do or what will inevitably take place. Though this predictive nuance
        is less common, it still aligns with the participle’s orientation toward
        future action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, the future participle is
        <strong>less frequently attested</strong> in the New Testament than its
        present or aorist counterparts, often appearing in contexts that are
        either formal, literary, or modeled on classical usage. Understanding
        its form and function, however, is crucial for the proper interpretation
        of nuanced theological and narrative developments, especially in
        Hellenistic Greek texts with elevated or rhetorical style.
