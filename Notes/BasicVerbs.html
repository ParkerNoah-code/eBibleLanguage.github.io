      <h2>Basic Verbs</h2>
      <p>
        Greek verbs communicate tense, voice, mood, person, and number. This
        section introduces the Present, Imperfect, and Future tenses in the
        Active Voice and Indicative Mood. These are the foundational verb forms
        for reading New Testament Greek.
      </p>

      <h3>Present Active Indicative</h3>
      <p>
        The Present Active Indicative describes ongoing, repeated, or habitual
        action occurring in the present time. It uses the present stem and
        primary active endings. This form is often used to state general truths
        or actions in progress.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Person</th>
            <th>Singular</th>
            <th>Plural</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>1st</td>
            <td>λύω</td>
            <td>λύομεν</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2nd</td>
            <td>λύεις</td>
            <td>λύετε</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3rd</td>
            <td>λύει</td>
            <td>λύουσι(ν)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Imperfect Active Indicative</h3>
      <p>
        The Imperfect Active Indicative describes continuous or repeated action
        in the past. It uses the present stem, adds an augment (usually ἐ-), and
        takes secondary active endings. This tense is commonly used to provide
        background information in narrative texts.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Person</th>
            <th>Singular</th>
            <th>Plural</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>1st</td>
            <td>ἔλυον</td>
            <td>ἐλύομεν</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2nd</td>
            <td>ἔλυες</td>
            <td>ἐλύετε</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3rd</td>
            <td>ἔλυε(ν)</td>
            <td>ἔλυον</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Future Active Indicative</h3>
      <p>
        The Future Active Indicative describes a simple action that will occur
        in the future. It is formed by adding the tense formative σ to the
        present stem and using primary active endings. This tense expresses
        predictive future events.

      <h3>Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        Aspect is a core grammatical feature of the Greek verb system,
        reflecting the speaker’s perspective on the action rather than merely
        its location in time. While English verbs primarily encode
        <i>tense</i> (past, present, future), Greek is an
        <b>aspect-prominent language</b>. This means that the grammatical forms
        of Greek verbs primarily convey <b>aspect</b>—the type or quality of the
        action—while <b>time</b> is typically secondary and only explicitly
        marked in the indicative mood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Verbal aspect refers to how an action is
        <i>conceptualized or portrayed</i> by the author: as ongoing, completed,
        or resulting in a present state. This perspective is not about the
        objective timing of an action but how the action is subjectively viewed.
        In Greek, aspect is always present in every verb form, while time
        reference is explicitly encoded only in the indicative mood and is
        inferred from context in all non-indicative moods (e.g., subjunctive,
        imperative, optative, infinitives, and participles).
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Common Tenses</th>
            <th>Typical Translation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Imperfective</b></td>
            <td>
              The action is portrayed as ongoing, continuous, repeated, or in
              progress without reference to its beginning or end. This aspect
              emphasizes process, incompletion, or habitual occurrence.
            </td>
            <td>Present, Imperfect</td>
            <td>
              <i>is teaching</i>, <i>was teaching</i>, <i>keeps teaching</i>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Perfective</b></td>
            <td>
              The action is viewed as a complete whole, with no focus on the
              internal structure of the event. It presents the action as
              occurring at a single point in time or as a summary event
              ("snapshot").
            </td>
            <td>Aorist</td>
            <td><i>taught</i>, <i>did teach</i></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Stative (or Resultative)</b></td>
            <td>
              The action is viewed as completed with enduring or resulting
              relevance to the present or past context. It often combines a
              sense of completion with a continuing state or consequence.
            </td>
            <td>Perfect, Pluperfect</td>
            <td><i>has taught</i>, <i>had taught</i></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        It is crucial to interpret Greek verbs based on aspect rather than
        simply time. For example, the <b>Imperfect</b> tense does not merely
        denote past action—it expresses action that was <i>in progress</i>,
        <i>incomplete</i>, or <i>iterative</i> in the past. The <b>Aorist</b>,
        despite often being translated with a past tense in English, does not
        inherently refer to past time but rather presents the action as a
        complete, undivided whole. The <b>Perfect</b> tense portrays a completed
        action with enduring consequences, often interpreted as having current
        significance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding Greek aspect is essential for accurate translation and
        exegesis. Since Greek verbs prioritize how an action is viewed rather
        than when it occurred, students of the language must analyze both the
        verb form and the literary context to discern meaning properly.
      </p>

      <h3>Verb Morphology</h3>
      <p>
        Greek verbs are formed by combining a <b>stem</b> with specific
        grammatical endings. These components work together to express
        <i>tense, aspect, voice, mood, person,</i> and <i>number</i>. The core
        components of a Greek verb form are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Augment</b> – A prefix (usually <i>ἐ-</i>) added in past tenses
          within the indicative mood
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stem</b> – The base or root of the verb that carries the essential
          meaning
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tense Formative</b> – A marker (e.g., <i>σ</i> in the Future)
          placed between the stem and ending to indicate tense/aspect
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Connecting Vowel</b> – Often <i>ο/ε</i> used between stem and
          ending (especially in the present system)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Personal Ending</b> – Encodes person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number
          (singular/plural), and sometimes mood and voice
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example – <b>λύσω</b> ("I will release") is broken down as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>λυ-</b> (stem)</li>
        <li><b>-σ-</b> (future tense formative)</li>
        <li><b>-ω</b> (1st person singular, primary active ending)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the imperfect tense, the verb <b>ἔλυον</b> ("I was releasing") has:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>ἐ-</b> (augment)</li>
        <li><b>λυ-</b> (present stem)</li>
        <li><b>-ον</b> (1st person singular, secondary active ending)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Mastery of Greek verb morphology allows learners to recognize and parse
        verbs correctly in context, especially as they encounter more complex
        tenses and voices.
      </p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>
        ὁ θεός λέγει τὸν λόγον – “God speaks the word.” Present tense indicates
        an action occurring now or habitually.
      </p>
      <p>
        ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐδίδασκεν τοὺς μαθητάς – “Jesus was teaching the disciples.”
        The Imperfect shows continuous past action.
      </p>
      <p>
        πιστεύσομεν εἰς τὸν κύριον – “We will believe in the Lord.” The Future
        expresses an anticipated action.
      </p>
