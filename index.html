      <h2>Learning Roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        The following roadmap is designed to get readers into the text quickly
        and to learn the grammar through extensive Scripture reading. I have
        made a concerted effort to ground grammatical principles in particular
        texts. One should be able to pick up their Greek New Testament and
        understand an increasing number of passages as one works their way
        through these lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="grammar/NounBasics.html">Noun Basics</a> is a great place to
        start. A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. Greek nouns have cases
        which inform us of their function in a sentence. They also have
        grammatical gender: masculine, feminine, or neuter. The article ("the")
        morphs to match nouns in gender, case, and number (singular or plural).
        Understand how the paradigmn tables work, reference them when needed for
        parsing (identifying gender, case, number, and root meaning), and start
        internalizing them. Basic vocabulary is given, but we will also look at
        book and passage specific vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
        After learning basic noun functions, several nexts steps are available
        to us.
        <a href="grammar/ThirdDeclensionNouns.html">Third Declension Nouns</a>
        are the same as basic first and second declension nouns conceptually,
        but the paradigms are more difficult and irregular. There's no rush to
        master them early on.
        <a href="grammar/AdjectivesAdverbs.html">Adjectives and Adverbs</a> do
        not require any further paradigm work. Adjectives, which modify nouns,
        morph like the nouns they are with, and adverbs, which modify verbs, do
        not morph at all.
        <a href="grammar/PersonalRelativePronouns.html"
          >Personal and Relative Pronouns</a
        >
        can be referenced and will probably be picked up fairly intuitively.
        <a href="grammar/Prepositions.html">Prepositions</a> are used with nouns
        to express relationships like place or means and can vary in meaning
        depending on the noun case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next major section to start on after learning about basic nouns is
        basic verbs, beginning with a
        <a href="grammar/VerbOverview.html">Verb Overview</a>. It is important
        to have a strong conceptual background for verbs before beginning to
        learn the paradigms. One should understand what person, number, voice,
        mood, and tense refer to. Aspect should especially be focused on.
        Although the <a href="grammar/ToBeForms.html">Forms of εἰμί</a>, the
        verb for "to be", are irregular, they are easy to learn and crucial to
        master.
