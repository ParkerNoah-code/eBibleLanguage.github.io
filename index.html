      <h2>Learning Roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        The following roadmap is designed to get readers into the text quickly
        and to learn the grammar through extensive Scripture reading. I have
        made a concerted effort to ground grammatical principles in particular
        texts. One should be able to pick up their Greek New Testament and
        understand an increasing number of passages as one works their way
        through these lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="grammar/NounBasics.html">Noun Basics</a> is a great place to
        start. A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. Greek nouns have cases
        which inform us of their function in a sentence. They also have
        grammatical gender: masculine, feminine, or neuter. The article ("the")
        morphs to match nouns in gender, case, and number (singular or plural).
        You should understand how the paradigm tables work. Start memorizing the
        first and second declension noun endings so that you can begin parsing
        without constantly checking the chart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exercise: I recommend starting with
        <a href="exercises/NounBasics.html">Mark 1</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After learning basic noun functions, several intermediate steps are
        available to us.
        <a href="grammar/ThirdDeclensionNouns.html">Third Declension Nouns</a>
        are the same as basic first and second declension nouns conceptually,
        but the paradigms are more difficult and irregular. There's no rush to
        master them early on.
        <a href="grammar/AdjectivesAdverbs.html">Adjectives and Adverbs</a> do
        not require any further paradigm work. Adjectives, which modify nouns,
        morph like the nouns they are with, and adverbs, which modify verbs, do
        not morph at all.
        <a href="grammar/PersonalRelativePronouns.html"
          >Personal and Relative Pronouns</a
        >
        can be referenced and will probably be picked up fairly intuitively.
        <a href="grammar/Prepositions.html">Prepositions</a> are used with nouns
        to express relationships like place or means and can vary in meaning
        depending on the case of the noun they are with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next major topic after learning about basic nouns is indicative
        verbs, beginning with a
        <a href="grammar/VerbOverview.html">Verb Overview</a>. We will start
        developing a strong conceptual understanding of verbs before going over
        paradigms. One should understand what person, number, voice, mood,
        tense, and aspect mean. Aspect should especially be focused on. After
        the overview, the first paradigms we will learn are the
        <a href="grammar/ToBeForms.html">Forms of εἰμί</a> (the verb for "to
        be"). Even though they are irregular, they are easy to learn and
        absolutely crucial in Koine Greek.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first regular verb tense paradigms to learn are the
        <a href="grammar/PresentIndicativeVerbs.html"
          >Present Indicative Verbs</a
        >
        and
        <a href="grammar/ImperfectIndicativeVerbs.html"
          >Imperfect Indicative Verbs</a
        >. They both fall under the same aspect indicating ongoing or repeated
        action but are used for the present and past respectively. Related to
        this, <a href="grammar/ContractVerbs.html">Contract Verbs</a> describe
        the way vowel stems combine with endings which often happens with
        morphology in these tenses. After this, we can learn about
        <a href="grammar/FutureIndicativeVerbs.html">Future Indicative Verbs</a>
        which are basically the same as present verbs but with a sigma added to
        the stem.
      </p>
      <p>
        After studying the first three tenses, we can move on to the
        <a href="grammar/AoristIndicativeVerbs.html">Aorist Indicative Verbs</a
        >. They have two common forms, one with a sigma and one without.
        <a href="grammar/LiquidVerbs.html">Liquid Verbs</a> describe the
        morphology for the verbs ending with λ, μ, ν, ρ. This equips us to learn
        about <a href="grammar/Infinitives.html">Infinitives</a> which are
        verbal nouns. We can also learn the last two major verb tenses with
        <a href="grammar/PerfectPluperfectIndicativeVerbs.html"
          >Perfect and Pluperfect Indicative Verbs</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the major verb paradigms, we can move on to the non-indicative
        moods with <a href="grammar/Subjunctives.html">Subjunctives</a>,
        <a href="grammar/Imperatives.html">Imperatives</a>, and
        <a href="grammar/Optatives.html">Optatives</a>. Lastly for verbs, we
        have <a href="grammar/MiVerbs.html">μί Verbs</a> which are a special
        class of irregular verbs that do not use the standard ω endings. They
        are not used often, but they are important. However, you could choose to
        come back to them at the end.
        <a href="grammar/OtherPronouns.html">Other Pronouns</a> and
        <a href="grammar/Numbers.html">Numbers</a> can be learned at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last major topic is participles. They are verbal adjectives that can
        be used in many ways. We will learn the four main types:
        <a href="grammar/PresentParticiples.html">Present Participles</a>,
        <a href="grammar/AoristParticiples.html">Aorist Participles</a>,
        <a href="grammar/PerfectParticiples.html">Perfect Participles</a>, and
        <a href="grammar/FutureParticiples.html">Future Participles</a>. They
        can be used to express action in relation to the main verb of a clause.
