      <h2>Learning Roadmap for Beginning Biblical Greek</h2>
      <p>
        This roadmap is structured to immerse learners in the Greek New
        Testament as early as possible, combining grammatical instruction with
        guided reading. The pedagogical philosophy is to anchor each grammatical
        topic in the context of real scriptural passages. This integration
        fosters lasting understanding, encourages intuitive pattern recognition,
        and facilitates reading fluency through active learning.
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction to Greek Nouns</h3>
      <p>
        Begin with the foundational study of
        <a href="grammar/NounBasics.html">Noun Basics</a>. Greek nouns convey
        information through <strong>case, gender, and number</strong>. The five
        cases (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Vocative) determine
        syntactic function. Nouns also possess grammatical gender (masculine,
        feminine, neuter), which affects article and adjective agreement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Learn the forms of the Greek article and how it agrees with nouns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Memorize first and second declension endings using paradigm tables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Begin parsing nouns by recognition, using morphology charts for
          support.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Intermediate Nominal Grammar</h3>
      <p>
        Expand your knowledge with additional noun forms and modifiers. You
        should make yourself comfortable with these topics, but they can be
        studied in any order after mastering the basics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="grammar/ThirdDeclensionNouns.html">Third Declension Nouns</a
          >: More complex stem and ending patterns, conceptually consistent with
          earlier declensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="grammar/Prepositions.html">Prepositions</a>: Govern cases and
          convey spatial, temporal, or instrumental relations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="grammar/AdjectivesAdverbs.html">Adjectives and Adverbs</a>:
          Adjectives morph like nouns; adverbs are indeclinable and modify verbs
          or clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="grammar/PersonalRelativePronouns.html"
            >Personal and Relative Pronouns</a
          >: High-frequency forms that should be recognized early.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="grammar/OtherPronouns.html">Other Pronouns</a>: Includes
          demonstrative, reflexive, reciprocal, indefinite, and interrogative;
          may require additional memorization.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Foundations of the Verbal System</h3>
      <p>
        Begin with a <a href="grammar/VerbOverview.html">Verb Overview</a> to
        build a conceptual framework. Understand the six components of a Greek
        verb: <strong>Person, Number, Voice, Mood, Tense, Aspect</strong>.
        Special attention should be paid to <em>aspect</em> (imperfective,
        perfective, stative) as it governs the action's nature.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="grammar/ToBeForms.html">Forms of εἰμί</a>: Master this
          essential irregular verb, foundational for New Testament syntax.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Present, Imperfect, and Future Indicative</h3>
      <p>
        Study these tenses in order, focusing on their morphology and aspectual
        meaning:

          <a href="grammar/PresentIndicativeVerbs.html">Present Indicative</a>:

        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="grammar/FutureIndicativeVerbs.html">Future Indicative</a>:
          Adds a sigma (σ) to the present stem, indicates future action.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Aorist, Liquid, Perfect, and Pluperfect Indicative</h3>
      <p>
        Progress to additional tenses to express varied temporal and aspectual
        contexts:

          <a href="grammar/AoristIndicativeVerbs.html">Aorist Indicative</a>:

            >Perfect and Pluperfect</a
          >: Stative aspect; result of completed action, expressed in present or
          past contexts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-Indicative Moods and Irregular Verbs</h3>
