      <h2>Verb Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Verbs carry a significant amount of grammatical information within a
        single form. Unlike English, where auxiliary words often carry the
        burden of expressing tense, mood, or voice, Greek verbs encode much of
        this information directly in their endings and forms. Five primary
        features define a verb in Greek:
        <strong>person</strong>, <strong>number</strong>,
        <strong>voice</strong>, <strong>mood</strong>, and
        <strong>tense-form</strong> (which incorporates aspect and, in certain
        contexts, time).
      </p>

      <h2>Person</h2>
      <p>
        Greek verbs indicate <strong>who</strong> is performing the action
        through their endings. There are three persons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First person</strong>: <em>I</em>, <em>we</em></li>
        <li><strong>Second person</strong>: <em>you</em>, <em>y'all</em></li>
        <li><strong>Third person</strong>: <em>he/she/it, they</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thus, the verb endings themselves already communicate the subject, and a
        subject pronoun (like <em>he</em> or <em>they</em>) is not strictly
        necessary in Greek.
      </p>

      <h2>Number</h2>
      <p>
        Greek verbs indicate whether the subject is
        <strong>singular</strong> or <strong>plural</strong>. A verb form will
        tell you if one subject (e.g., <em>he teaches</em>) or multiple subjects
        (e.g., <em>they teach</em>) are performing the action.
      </p>

      <h2>Voice</h2>
      <p>
        Voice expresses the
        <strong>relationship between the subject and the action</strong> of the
        verb. Biblical Greek uses three primary voices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Active</strong>: the subject performs the action (<em
            >He teaches</em
          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Middle</strong>: the subject acts with reference to itself or
          for its own benefit (<em>He teaches himself</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Passive</strong>: the subject receives the action (<em
            >He is taught</em
          >).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mood</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>mood</strong> of a verb indicates the manner in which the
        action is conceived—whether it is a statement of fact, a possibility, a
        command, or a wish. The major moods in Biblical Greek are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Indicative</strong>: factual statements of reality (<em
            >He teaches</em
          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subjunctive</strong>: probable or possible actions (<em
            >He may teach</em
          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Imperative</strong>: commands or exhortations
          (<em>Teach!</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optative</strong>: wishes or potential situations (<em
            >May he teach</em
          >).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thus, mood conveys the <em>attitude</em> or <em>perspective</em> of the
        speaker toward the action of the verb.
      </p>

      <h2>Tense-Form (Aspect and Time)</h2>
      <p>
        The Greek tense system is one of the most important—and most
        misunderstood—features for beginning students. Unlike English, Greek
        tenses are not primarily about chronological time. Instead, they
        primarily express <strong>aspect</strong>—the way an action is viewed or
        portrayed.
        <strong>Time is only communicated in the indicative mood.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Aspect</h2>
      <p>
        Aspect refers to whether an action is ongoing, complete, or
        results-oriented:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Imperfective Aspect</strong>: presents the action as ongoing,
          repeated, or progressive.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Present tense</strong>: ongoing in the present (<em
                >He is teaching</em
              >).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Imperfect tense</strong>: ongoing in the past (<em
                >He was teaching</em
              >).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perfective Aspect</strong>: presents the action as a whole or
          complete.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Aorist tense</strong>: simple, complete action in the past
              (<em>He taught</em>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Future tense</strong>: simple, complete action in the
              future (<em>He will teach</em>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stative Aspect</strong>: presents a completed action with
          continuing results.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Perfect tense</strong>: completed with results in the
              present (<em>He has taught</em>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pluperfect tense</strong>: completed with results in the
              past (<em>He had taught</em>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Time in the Indicative</h2>
      <p>
        Only when a verb is in the <strong>indicative mood</strong> does
        tense-form communicate <strong>time</strong> in addition to aspect. For
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Present indicative → ongoing action in the present.</li>
        <li>Aorist indicative → simple completed action in the past.</li>
        <li>Future indicative → simple completed action in the future.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Outside of the indicative, tense-form signals aspect alone, not time.
        For instance, in the imperative, aorist vs. present simply shows whether
        a command should be viewed as a single, whole action or an
        ongoing/repeated one.
