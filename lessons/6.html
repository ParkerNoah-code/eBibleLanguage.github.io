      <h2>Imperfect Indicative Verbs</h2>
      <p>
        The imperfect tense in Greek communicates
        <strong>ongoing or repeated action in the past</strong>. It contrasts
        with the <strong>aorist</strong>, which usually describes a simple,
        completed past action.
      </p>

      <p>There are three main uses of the imperfect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Progressive Imperfect</strong> (ongoing past action):
          Describes someone actively doing something in the past.
          <em>Example:</em> “He was teaching the crowds.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inceptive Imperfect</strong> (beginning of an action):
          Stresses the start of an action. <em>Example:</em> “They began to
          shout.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterative Imperfect</strong> (repeated action): Highlights
          repeated or habitual action in the past. <em>Example:</em> “He kept
          knocking.”
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>In Discourse:</strong> The imperfect can sometimes serve as
        <strong>background information</strong>, giving a scene-setting
        description in contrast with the <strong>foreground action</strong> of
        the aorist tense.

      <h4>Middle/Passive Voice</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1st sg. <strong>ἐλυόμην</strong> – I was being loosed / I was loosing

      <p>
        Context determines which voice is intended, as the forms are identical.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Morphological Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Augment (ἐ-)</strong>: marks the verb as past tense.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connecting vowels</strong>: vary slightly between active and
          middle/passive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Endings</strong>: similar to present tense endings, but
          adapted for past time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>1st singular and 3rd plural active forms</strong> are
          identical (<strong>ἔλυον</strong>), so context determines the subject.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Translation Tip:</strong> The imperfect is often best understood
        as “in-progress” past action. When translating, you can often render it
        as “was ___ing” or “kept on ___ing.”
