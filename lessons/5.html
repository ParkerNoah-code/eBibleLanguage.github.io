      <h2>Present Indicative Verbs</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>present tense in Greek</strong> is not primarily about time
        but about <strong>aspect</strong>&mdash;the type of action being
        portrayed. Time reference (present, past, future) comes mostly from
        context.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Progressive Present</strong>: Expresses action as
          <em>ongoing or unfolding in real time</em>. Example: "I am writing..."
          (<em>γράφω</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterative Present</strong>: Conveys a
          <em>habitual or repeated action</em>. Example: "He often says..." (<em
            >λέγει</em
          >
          in a context of repeated speech).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Historical Present</strong>: Used in narrative to describe
          <em>past events vividly in the present tense</em>. Often occurs with
          verbs of speech (<em>λέγω</em>) or motion (<em>ἔρχομαι</em>). Creates
          dramatic immediacy, as though the event is happening before your eyes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Present Indicative Paradigms</h2>
      <p>
        The model verb <em>λύω</em> is the standard paradigm for regular
        <strong>present active indicative</strong> endings.
      </p>

      <h4>Active Voice</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Singular</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>1st: λύω &mdash; I am loosing</li>
            <li>2nd: λύεις &mdash; you are loosing</li>
            <li>3rd: λύει &mdash; he/she/it is loosing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plural</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>1st: λύομεν &mdash; we are loosing</li>
            <li>2nd: λύετε &mdash; y'all are loosing</li>
            <li>3rd: λύουσι(ν) &mdash; they are loosing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The (ν) at the end of λύουσι(ν) is called a <strong>movable nu</strong>.
        Be aware that it is not always present.
      </p>

      <h4>Middle / Passive Voice</h4>
      <p>
        In the <strong>present tense</strong>, middle and passive forms share
        the same endings. The context determines whether the meaning is
        <em>middle</em> ("I loose for myself") or <em>passive</em> ("I am being
        loosed").
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Singular</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>1st: λύομαι &mdash; I loose for myself / I am being loosed</li>
            <li>
              2nd: λύῃ &mdash; you loose for yourself / you are being loosed
            </li>
            <li>
              3rd: λύεται &mdash; he/she/it looses for himself/herself / is
              being loosed
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plural</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1st: λυόμεθα &mdash; we loose for ourselves / we are being loosed
            </li>
            <li>
              2nd: λύεσθε &mdash; y'all loose for yourselves / are being loosed
            </li>
            <li>
              3rd: λύονται &mdash; they loose for themselves / are being loosed
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Endings</strong> are the markers of person and number:
          <ul>
            <li>Active: -ω, -εις, -ει, -ομεν, -ετε, -ουσι(ν)</li>
            <li>Middle/Passive: -ομαι, -ῃ, -εται, -όμεθα, -εσθε, -ονται</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contract verbs</strong> (ending in -αω, -εω, -οω) follow the
          same pattern but with vowel contraction. This will be covered in a
          later lesson.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>present tense stem</strong> (λύ-) stays consistent, and
          endings attach directly.
        </li>
      </ul>
